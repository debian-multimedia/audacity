audacity (1.3.6-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added myself to Uploaders.
  * Wrapped Uploaders and Build-Depends fields.
  * Ordered and cleaned up Build-Depends, added autotools-dev.
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.8.0.
  * Moved Homepage from package description to Source stanza.
  * Added ${misc:Depends} to Depends.
  * Added MP2-support via libtwolame (Closes: #448762, #481338).
  * Removed obsolete audacity.dirs and blank lines in
    debian/audacity.install and debian/rules.
  * Use Applications/Sound in audacity.menu.
  * Use sf.net redirector in debian/watch.
  * Fixed syntax errors in architecture checks in debian/rules
    (Closes: #486147).
  * Removed redundant debhelper calls from debian/rules and force remove
    of the license file.
  * Added patch to fix hyphen-used-as-minus-sign, thanks lintian.
  * Added an audacity-dbg debug package.
  * Versioned Build-Depends on libsoundtouch1-dev (>= 1.3.1-2) and
    explicitely enable it in the configure flags (Closes: #459198).
  * Added advice to also remove '~/.audacity' to debian/NEWS (Closes: #463955).
  * Added Build-Conflicts against libwxbase2.6-dev and wx2.6-headers
    (Closes: #405623).
  * Explicitely built against the system libsamplerate, effectively disabling
    the internal libresample. This may break support for proprietary VST
    plug-ins! Left a notice in debian/NEWS.
  * Reordered configure flags in debian/rules and renamed
    T1_DEB_CONFIGURE_EXTRA_FLAGS to the more descriptive WITH_JACK_CONFFLAG.
  * Audacity suggests libmp3lame0.
  * Added an arch:all audacity-data package that contains most of the
    architecture-independent content of the '/usr/share' directory.
  * Fixed faulty confflags --with-libid3tag and --with-libvorbis.
  * Remove the redundant LICENSE.txt file immediately after the install rule.
  * Do not manually remove lib-src/libpormixer.a in the clean rule. We build
    --without-portmixer anyway.

audacity (1.1.99pre3-1) unstable; urgency=low

audacity (1.1.99pre1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream 1.2 prerelease.  Far too many new features to list.
  * Audacity 1.2 does not support opening MIDI files, so the
    Open Midi -> Export Ogg crash is no longer triggerable (closes: #150654)
  * Audacity 1.2 performs checks to guard against multiple instances
    running concurrently, to prevent multiple instances from interfering
    with each others temporary files.  (closes: #182782)
  * We now use libsndfile for sound file i/o, so 8 bit files should
    no longer be distorted.  (closes: #187304)
  * Recompile should fix weird, unexplainable, unreproducable runtime
    linking error. (closes: #187504)
  * Audacity 1.2 has a completely new audio i/o backend.  The code that
    caused a problem when changing devices in the preferences has been
    completely rewritten.  (closes: #188808)
  * We no longer link against id3lib (thank goodness) so the FTBFS that
    was clearly caused by id3lib should no longer be an issue.
    (closes: #192328)
  * "<" and ">" removed from URL display to prevent the URL from disappearing
    entirely from the packages.d.o web pages that don't properly escape them.

audacity (0.98-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * New build-depends on libwxgtk2.2-dev (>=2.2.9.2) should solve any
    remaining libpng problems.  This will effectively revert us back to
    libpng2, since this is what the libwxgtk2.2 maintainer decided on.

audacity (0.97.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Eliminated build-dependency on 'zip' by pre-zipping the help file. I was
    previously unaware that zip is in non-us, making the build-dep a policy
    violation. Unfortunately, this required a new source tarball, since
    Debian diffs don't seem to allow binary files.

audacity (0.97.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upstream prerelease. Upstream we have fixed many important bugs, but
    the next full release may not be ready for Debian's freeze. These
    fixes should definitely go in woody.
  * Audacity no longer includes its own complete copy of libmpeg3 and
    id3lib; instead we link against the debian packages libmad0-dev and
    libid3-dev. This effectively sidesteps the problems of id3lib
    building (or not building) on 64 bit architectures.
