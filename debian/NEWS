  * Explicitly built against the system libsamplerate, effectively disabling
    the internal libresample. This may break support for proprietary VST

audacity (1.3.4-1.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * This update fixes a security issue (CVE-2007-6061).
  * Please either delete both ~/.audacity-data/audacity.cfg and
    ~/.audacity or change the value of TempDir in audacity.cfg to
    <PATHTOYOURHOME>/.audacity1.3-<YOURUSERNAME>
    to prevent other local users from performing a symlink attack
    resulting in potential data loss of your local files.
